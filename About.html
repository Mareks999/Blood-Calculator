        <h1>About Blood Pressure Calculator</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Blood Pressure Calculator! This tool helps you understand and monitor your blood pressure readings to maintain good health.</p>
        
        <h2>What is Blood Pressure?</h2>
        <p>Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as two numbers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Systolic pressure:</strong> The pressure when your heart beats and pushes blood through your arteries.</li>
            <li><strong>Diastolic pressure:</strong> The pressure when your heart is at rest between beats.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Measure Your Blood Pressure</h2>
        <p>Before using the calculator, you need accurate blood pressure readings. Here's how to measure it properly:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare:</strong> Rest for at least 5 minutes before measuring. Avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for 30 minutes prior.</li>
            <li><strong>Position:</strong> Sit comfortably with your back supported, feet flat on the floor, and arm at heart level. Use either arm; if there is a consistent difference, use the arm with the higher reading.</li>
            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Use a validated blood pressure monitor (automatic or manual sphygmomanometer). Avoid using finger or wrist devices for accuracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Measure:</strong> Wrap the cuff snugly around your upper arm. Follow the device instructions to take the reading.</li>
            <li><strong>Record:</strong> Note both systolic and diastolic numbers. Take 2-3 readings a minute apart and average them.</li>
            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Measure at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before eating and before taking blood pressure medications, unless your doctor advises otherwise.</li>
        </ol>
